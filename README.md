# eka-challenge
For this technical challenge, we would like you to provide an interface for a user to input information, query the DAT API based on the information given, and then render the results to the user.

1. Hooked up Application to redux.
2. Used React Router to manage urls.
3. Used Redux form and built in methods for validation.
4. Instead of using absolute paths for components aliases were used from Webpack.
5. Live site is hosted on github pages. [here](https://karann7.github.io/eka-challenge/)
6. Please press the back button on arrival so that the router can reset to index. (github pages issue)
